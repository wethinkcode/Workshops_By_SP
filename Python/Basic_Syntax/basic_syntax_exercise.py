# Python Basic Syntax

# 1. Variables: You can store values in variables.
x = 10  
y = 20.5  
z = "Hello, World!"  
a = True  
b = False  

# Use the print statement and the variable 'x' to display the message:
    # "10, is an integer variable."
print()    
# Use the print statement and the variable 'y' to display the message: 
    # "20.5, is a float variable."
print()
# Use the print statement and the variable 'z' to display the message: 
    # " 'Hello, World!' is a string variable."
print()
# Use the print statement and the variable 'a' to display the message:
    # " 'True', is a boolean variable."
print()
# Use the print statement and the variable 'b' to display the message:
    # " 'False', is a boolean variable.

# 2. Data Types: Python has several built-in data types.
# Edit the code below to print:
    # "10 belongs to <class 'int'>: meaning it is an integer."
print(type(x))
# Edit the code below to print:
    # " 20.5 belongs to <class 'float'>: meaning it is a float."
print(type(y))
# Edit the code below to print:
    # " 'Hello, World!', belongs to <class 'str'>: meaning it is a string."
print(type(z))
# Edit the code below to print:
    # "'True', belongs to <class 'bool'>: meaning it is a boolean."
print(type(a))
# Edit the code below to print:
    # "'False', belongs to <class 'bool'>: meaning it is a boolean.
print(type(b))

# 3. Basic Operators: 
    # Python supports various operators for performing operations on data.
# Arithmetic Operators

# Addition: print the sum of x and y
print()
# Subtraction: print the difference between x and y
print()
# Multiplication: print the product of x and y
print()
# Division: print the answer when you divide x by y
print()
# Modulus (remainder of the division): print the remainder after dividing x by y
print()

# 4. Indentation: 
    # Python uses indentation to indicate the beginning and end of code blocks.
# Complete the for loop below to print numbers 0 to 5    
for number in range(6):
    print()  # This line is part of the for loop because it's indented.
