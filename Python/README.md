# Python Fundamentals Learning Path

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals learning path! This section of the repository is designed to help you build a strong foundation in Python programming. We will cover a range of essential topics, including basic syntax, control structures, functions, data structures, and more. For each topic, you will find an exercise to complete and a solution to review.

## Basic Syntax

### Exercise: Variables and Data Types

1. **Variables and Data Types**: In this exercise, you will work with variables and data types. You will use Python variables to store values of different types (integers, floats, strings, booleans) and display messages using the `print` statement based on the variable values.

2. **Data Types**: You will explore Python's built-in data types and use the `type()` function to identify the data types of variables.

3. **Basic Operators**: You will practice using various arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder).

4. **Indentation**: You will complete a for loop to print numbers from 0 to 5 and learn about the importance of indentation in Python.

Your task is to complete the exercises for each topic before moving on to the next. Have fun learning Python!
